; Type of annotations the model predicts. Note that this may be different from the "annotationType" property. For example, a setup could have users provide classification labels, but a model predicting points. In this case, "annotationType" would be "classLabels", "predictionType" would be set to "points". Note that this would require translating to usable ground truth in the AI model.
